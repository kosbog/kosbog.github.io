    "From childhood I didn't dream about that I will sit at the computer and write a code - I wanted to become a professional football player. I even played for the school football team, yeah!.. But, my \"football career\" ended when I started studying at the university. I have a fancy for web development in the second year of study. Thereat in simple textpad I created my first HTML page and connected my first CSS file to it. It was an unforgettable feeling!"
